        int savings = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < weeks ; i++)
        {
            int subtract = (d*(d+1))/2;
            
            savings += ((7+d)*(7+d+1))/2 - subtract;
            
            d = d+1;
        }
        
        int subtract = (d*(d+1))/2;
        savings += ((oddDays+d)*(oddDays+d+1))/2-subtract;
