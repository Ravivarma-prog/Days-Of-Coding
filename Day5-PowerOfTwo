Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2. (Inc. Negative number)

Approach : If a number is less than 0 it can't be power of 2. If a number is positive then n&(n-1) should be zero for power of 2
           A number is power of two if it has only on set bit and the previous number has all set bits. The AND of these should give 0
           
Time Complexity :  O(1)
Space Complexity : O(1)

public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if(n<=0)
            return false;
        return (n & (n-1))==0;
    }
};
