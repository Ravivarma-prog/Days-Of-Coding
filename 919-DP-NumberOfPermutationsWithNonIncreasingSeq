/*

Number of permutations of {1, â€¦, n} that avoid the pattern 123 (or any of the other patterns of length 3); that is, the number of permutations with no three-term increasing subsequence. For n = 3,
 these permutations are 132, 213, 231, 312 and 321. 
 For n = 4, they are 1432, 2143, 2413, 2431, 3142, 3214, 3241, 3412, 3421, 4132, 4213, 4231, 4312 and 4321
 
 n = 2 the sequence out of {1,2} is 21
 n = 1 the sequence out of {1}  is 1

Applications of catalan numbers:

1. Number of BST from given n

2. Number of balanced parantheses that can be formed with n pairs

3. Number of triangles formed form convex polygon of n+2 sides

4.Number of paths with 2n steps in a nxn grid to move from (0,0) to (n-1,n-1) without crossing the diagonal ( from bottom left to top right )

5.Number of ways to insert n pair of parantheses into n+1 letters
