Given N friends, each one can remain single or can be paired up with some other friend.
Each friend can be paired only once. Find out the total number of ways in which friends can remain single or can be paired up.
Note: Since answer can be very large, return your answer mod 10^9+7.

Approach :

If a friend is single , then go with remaining n-1 friends
If a friend is paired , then he will be paired with n-1 persons and go with the remaining n-2 persons

pair[n] = pair[n-1] + (n-1) * pair[n-2]

if n = 3 

Friend 3 can be single and go with 2 persons. 2 persons can be paired in 2 ways
Friend 3 can be paired and he will be paired like (1 3) and (2 3), the remaining 1 person can be paired with 1 ways. So it will be 2 * 1 ways

if n = 4

Friend 4 can be single and go with 3 person . 3 persons paired in 4 ways
Friend 4 can be paired like (1 4) (2 4) (3 4) and the remaining 2 persons can be paired in 2 ways for each pair

i.e (1 4) (2 3)
    (1 4) (2) (3)
    (2 4) (1 3)
    (2 4) (1) (3)
    (3 4) (1 2)
    (3 4) (1) (2)
    
    that is why n-1 * pair(n-2)
