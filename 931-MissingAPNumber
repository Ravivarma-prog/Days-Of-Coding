You are given a sorted array of ‘N’ distinct integers that are in the Arithmetic Progression sequence 
except for one element which is missing from the sequence. You have to find that missing number from the given sequence.

Code :

int missingNumber(vector<int> &arr, int n) 
{
    int d = (arr[n-1]-arr[0])/n;
    
    int left = 0 ,  right = n-1;
    
    while(left < right)
    {
        int mid = left + (right-left)/2;
        int n1 = mid-left+1;
//         int n2 = right-mid+1;
        
        if(mid > 0 && arr[mid-1] != arr[mid]-d)
            return arr[mid]-d;
        
        if(mid < n-1 && arr[mid+1] != arr[mid]+d)
            return arr[mid]+d;
        
        int leftNth = arr[left] + (n1-1)*d; // a+(n-1)d
//         int rightNth = nums[mid] + (n2-1)*d;
        
        if(arr[mid] != leftNth)
        {
            right = mid-1;
        }
        
        else
        {
            left = mid;
        }
        
    }
	return -1;
}
