Given an array/list 'ARR' of ‘N’ distinct integers, you are supposed to find the third largest element in the given array 'ARR'.

Approach : Three variables to maintain the track of first,second and third largest variable.

Time Complexity : O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Code:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

int findThirdLagrest(vector < int > & arr) {
 	int first , second , third;
    
    first = second = third = INT_MIN;
    
    for(int i : arr)
    {
        if(i>first)
        {
            third = second;
        	second = first;
            first = i;
        }
        
        else if(i < first && i > second)
        {
            third = second;
            second  =i;
        }
        
        else if(i < first && i < second && i > third)
            third = i;
    }
    return  third;
}
